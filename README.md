librosa is a Python library for analyzing audio and music. It has a flatter package layout, standardizes interfaces and names, backwards compatibility, modular functions, and readable code. Further, in this Python mini-project, we demonstrate how to install it (and a few other packages) with pip.

For this Python mini project, iâ€™ll use the RAVDESS dataset; this is the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song dataset, and is free to download. This dataset has 7356 files rated by 247 individuals 10 times on emotional validity, intensity, and genuineness. The entire dataset is 24.8GB from 24 actors, but i have downloade the lowered the sample rate version, downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wWsrN2Ep7x6lWqOXfr4rpKGYrJhWc8z7/view.
